### Well that was easy!

I realized the other day that there were no ClojureScript REPLs in [SublimeREPL](https://github.com/wuub/SublimeREPL), the REPL plugin for Sublime Text 2 and 3. No hard work on my part, just a simple commit that added a config file, but as SublimeREPL 2.0.0, the plugin now has two REPLs for ClojureScript: a browser REPL and a Rhino REPL.

Version 2.0.0 is now available via [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control). Thanks to [@wuub](https://twitter.com/wuub) for all of the amazing hard work.

Enjoy!
